% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}
% \input{abstract}
