% Abstract
Around the world, falls among the elderly are occurring more frequently than during any other time in history. Unlike other age groups, falls in the elderly pose serious health risks due to the increased potential for health-related consequences that transpire after a fall has occurred. Fall-related injuries currently cost \$34 billion direct healthcare costs in the USA. In Canada and other countries, direct medical expenses are in the tens of billions. Fall alarm and fall detection systems exist but have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficacy. In this paper we describe an innovative fall detection algorithm and report on real test case scenarios. Our solution offers the following benefits: 1) it is a lightweight application that can run on any low-powered device such as Arduinos, or Raspberry Pis; 2) it unobtrusively monitors the senior and requires no involvement from the resident; 3) it is easily deployed to any home or senior living environment; 4) it does not require the senior to wear a special wearable; and 5) it is secure and confidential—all  processing and decision making is done locally—only notifications indicating that a fall has been detected are transmitted to stakeholders. In real test case scenarios, our system was able to achieve 97\% accuracy compared to ground truth.
